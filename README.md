# baku

A basic blog where I write down curious dreams - only in french for now.
It was made following the awesome tutorial Django Girls, you can find it at https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/

Thanks to Django Girls Paris <3

Note: according to wikipedia, "Baku (獏 or 貘?) are Japanese supernatural beings that devour dreams and nightmares".
